# Ducky Scripts Collection
Please do not use these scripts for harmful purposes !

You'll find the scripts in the [repository's wiki](https://github.com/TheTeasel/DuckyScripts_Collection/wiki).

I recommend using [Hak5 Ducky Encoder](https://shop.hak5.org/pages/ducky-encoder) or [Ducktoolkit]https://ducktoolkit.com/) to quickly encode the payloads.
